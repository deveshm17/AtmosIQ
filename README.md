# 🌍 AtmosIQ – Atmospheric Intelligence Platform

AtmosIQ is a simple air-quality monitoring project designed to demonstrate
how AQI data can be processed and visualized using clean and beginner-friendly code.

The project focuses on clarity, modularity, and explainability rather than
complex machine learning models.

## Features
- Basic AQI data processing
- Simple backend API
- Modular folder structure
- Easy to explain logic (interview-friendly)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Basic data handling (CSV-based)

## Project Goal
To build a clean and understandable project that shows how environmental
data can be managed and displayed.

## How it Works
1. AQI data is read from a CSV file
2. Values are processed using simple functions
3. Results are served via a backend API
4. Frontend displays the processed data

## Author
Developed as a learning-focused full-stack project.
